# 7-Segment-P5JS
a 7-segments display class for p5.js or similar languages.
this is my first giyhub post or whatever it called..
and i made this 7-segments display template that was inspired by "theCodingTrain" channel (or Daniel Shiffman), and i decided to make a better version of what he did , so i made this class based project where you can put simple inputs and display it rapidly , but if you are an advanced user you can tweak with settings and they are easy to edit , also easy to convert for other languages just change the syntax and here you go , you've got efficient and lightweight display..

TODO :
i will consider making it a library and adding more features to draw other forms and make it easy for you ...
